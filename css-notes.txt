===== CSS PROPERTY EXPLORATION ACTIVITY

A list of questions for each breakout room is listed below.

Decide as a group how to best divide up your breakout room questions between group members.
Individuals/groups of team members will then research answers to a question and prepare coding
examples (where applicable) to best illustrate the topic/answer.

Some questions are harder than others so if you finish early, assist other group members with answering additional/harder questions.

Collaborate with your group and share with each other what you found in researching your questions.

Designate one or two presenters in the group to present the findings of the group to the class.

If your group finishes early, feel free to help out other groups.

We will begin group presentations at 3:00PM.

Aim to present for around 5 minutes or less and expect questions.



===== GROUP 1 - Specificity (CAPTAIN AMERICA)

Specificity https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity

Using the curriculum and above article as a reference, create examples to demo the specificity of the following in the correct order:
Elements, classes, then id

  classes - <class=“”> declared with . In the front
  elements - <p> <div>
  ids - starts with #

If element and ID, are both defined, id will take precedence

  !important - used to override; edge case

  order of CSS declarations

  inline styling
  selector combinations


What does the “Cascading” mean in “Cascading Style Sheets”?



===== GROUP 2 - Color Properties (IRON MAN)

  How does hexadecimal color coding work?
Base 16 color system; 3-digits or 6-digits

  Why use CSS color names over hex values and vice versa?
Color names are simpler and take less space

  How can CSS transform rotate or change the size of a displayed element?

  How do CSS transitions work (focus on a simple example)?
