# Intro to Java
​
## Java Highlights
​
- one of the most widely used programming languages in history
- strong continuing demand for Java developers
- often used in Computer Science programs as an introduction to programming
- predominantly used in enterprise web app development and Android mobile development
- developed at Sun Microsystems in the early nineties (primary designer, James Gosling)
- Java was made to be fast, secure, and flexible enough to run on any hardware and OS
​
## JavaScript vs. Java
​
- Hamburger vs. Ham (languages are not directly related)
- JavaScript primarily runs on a browser engine... Java on any JVM on any machine
- JavaScript is dynamically types (variables may be reassigned a different data type)... Java variables must be of a declared types and cannot be changed to a different type
- Objects in JavaScript were mostly equivalent to a named index array... Java objects are entirely different
- JavaScript statements may be inside or outside functions, arrays, objects, etc.... Java statements must be written inside methods inside a class
- We will use JavaScript during this program for client-side (browser or front-end) scripting... we will use Java for server-side (back end) scripting
- JavaScript is single-threaded... Java is multi-threaded
- JavaScript is a relatively high-level language (lower performance, simpler syntax)... Java is more a mid-level language (higher performance, more explicit syntax)

## How Java Runs
​
1. Programmer writes source code in a .java file (the following additional steps may be done automatically by an IDE or manually)
1. .java file is compiled by the Java Compiler into a .class file that contains Java bytecode instructions (normally hexadecimal/binary code that map to Java opcodes)
1. .class file may then be run on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
1. the JVM implements the bytecode instructions in a specific operating system way, depending on which JVM version the code is running on
