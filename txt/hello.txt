Hewo!

How are you doing today?

I hope you are doing well.

Today is my second day of Codeup!

I'm having a solid week so far.

Tomorrow is a half-day and we're diving into JS.

My favorite part so far is how helpful the instructors have been.

I'm looking forward to new opportunities.

I want to gain lots of programming experience, and also want to learn lots of interview tips.
