DOM Events

Type is a string
Listener is a function

Can pass a defined function (sayHello) or write function inside parentheses

Why would you use an anonymous function here, why would you use a callback?
â€”callback function can be used anywhere and is readily available to be used, anonymous function will generally only be used in only one place in our JavaScript
