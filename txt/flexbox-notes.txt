FLEXBOX
Good for positioning elements with individual components

Parent container is called the Flex Container

Activate flex box with display: flex in parent container
Default is items lining up one after the other

Spacing between items in main axis

When in column layout, main axis is up and down
-makes sense because you can control spacing between items in a drop down list

FLEX CONTAINER PROPERTIES:

Flex-direction: row - changes to rows
Flex-direction: row-reverse - turns items around, still in row
Flex-direction: column - changes to columns
flex-direction: column-reverse - items bottom to top, still in column
CROSS-AXIS

Justify-content: flex-start - puts contents on left
Justify-content: flex-end - aligns items along end of line
Justify-content: space-between: stretches along whole line
Justify-content: space-around - 50% of the space bat beginning and end; if you add those values, they will equal space between the items
Justify-content: space-evenly - take the same amount of empty space at beginning/end as it does with every item
Justify-content: center - centers items; no space between content, even space at top-bottom/left-right
MAIN-AXIS

Align-items is used to set to position of items along the cross axis; parent container must have a greater height than the items

Align-items: flex-start - places items at ‘top’ of container
Align-items: flex-end - places items at ‘bottom’ of container
Align-items: stretch - default, goes from ‘top’ of container to ‘bottom’
Align-items: center - centers items along cross axis
Align-items: baseline

Flex-wrap: nowrap:
Flex-wrap: wrap - puts items on different lines
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse - turns items around on different lines

Align-content is for multiple rows/columns, create space between rows, not between items; CROSS AXIS

FLEX ITEM PROPERTIES:

Order: the first flex item has an order value of 1
	    the last flex item has an order value of 2
Flex-grow: will fill container; default is 0, if set to 0 it cannot stretch beyond normal size
As numbers go up, more proportions are taken (weighted)
