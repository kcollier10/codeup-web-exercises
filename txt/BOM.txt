BOM (Browser Object Model)

-alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are BOMs
-Qualities of objects in JS - can have values, can have properties, can have methods
-clearInterval stops the setInterval
-setTimeout and clearTimeout will return an id
-Can name variables whatever, can’t change setInterval or clearInterval
-setInterval - set to variable since you’ll be using clearInterval
-Both take in two functions () {}; () can be named or empty
-As soon as page loads, multiple BOMs will start; not one right after the other
-Can be paused while waiting for user interaction
-Order doesn’t matter, both will start on page load
