Map, filter, reduce

.filter -
 Can return true; return !user;
Should return a boolean value
Can also do !object to return false
False returns an empty array
If true, it doesn't filter anything out


.map -
Will not modify original array, instead creates new one
Like an advanced forEach loop - cannot specify a stopping point
“forEach loop with added stuff”
Produces an array with same length as original array


.map can be used for double checking user input
-built mad-libs javascript and was able to lowercase all elements in an array before the conditionals using .map

.reduce -
Has two parameters - accumulation and current value
Accumulator has a starting point
-can be listed as an empty string if you’re expecting the value of the returned items to be a string
-can use any number as starting point
