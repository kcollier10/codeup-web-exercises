DOM (Document Object Model)

A browser api that creates a tree-like structure of JS objects to represent and allow manipulation of a web page
Using JS code, we van access and manipulate nodes, their properties, and any descendent nodes, giving us control over the elements of a web page

getElementByID - only selects one thing

HTMLCollection is NOT the same thing as an array
Can’t use pop, push, shift, unshift because they only work with arrays
Can play with JS console because we don’t have an IFFE yet
However, you can convert HTMLCollection to array

getElementByTagName - example: sections
Can access the first one by using brackets []

querySelector() can replace the above methods
Id uses a ‘#’ like in CSS

Accessing form text can be done, usually used in website where empty fields don’t allow the submit button to work

Adding a name to a form will allow you to access different forms

innerText doesn’t pay as much attention to elements inside, pays more attention to text; strips out the tags
