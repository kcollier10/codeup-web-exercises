# HTML Forms Pre Lesson
1. What HTTP methods can we use in forms?
GET - requests information WITHOUT changing data on the server
POST - makes a change to the existing data

2. What happens if we do not specify a method?
The GET method can be used

3. What is a `GET` method?
Should never be used with sensitive data, only used to request/GET data; DO save in the browser history; can be bookmarked

4. What is a `POST` method?
Used to send data to a server to create/update a resource; cannot be bookmarked; post requests do not remain in the browser history

5. What is the `action` attribute used for?
Refers to the location the data should be sent; if no action is specified, the action will be set to send data back to the Curren URL

6. What is a `query string`?
Composed of key-value pairs; when you use the GET method, the form inputs will be appended to the URL; if you are using POST, inputs will be sent as a query string (no question mark add) in the body of the HTTP request

7. How are query strings structured?
?key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3

8. How do we submit a form?
Form needs a button or input element with a type attribute with the value ‘submit’; inputs are void elements

9. What are some common form input elements?
Text inputs (username/passwords)
Text areas (user input like bio)
Checkboxes (multiple answer questions)
Radio buttons (multiple choice questions)
Selects (drop down menus)
Hidden inputs (for backend of applications; sends data with form that user does no specify or modify)

10. How can we use name and value attributes?
In order for input to be submitted, we must give it a name attribute. The value of the name attribute will become the name of the key that corresponds to the value of the current input

11. How do you disable an input?
Put ‘disabled’ inside the tags (<option disabled value=“n”> or <input type=“text” value=“Codeup” disabled>

12. How do you hide an input?
Input type = “hidden”

13. What are `labels` used for?
