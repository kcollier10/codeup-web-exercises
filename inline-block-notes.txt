Difference between inline and block element:
Inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow
Block - div
Inline -span

Float: provides the ability for the element to break free from the normal document flow and shift to the left or right as far as possible

The default value for elements is static

The clear property sets whether an element must be moved below floating elements that precede it; applies to floating and non-floating elements


static:
 Default positioning, positioned according to natural flow of the document, top, right, bottom, and left have NO EFFECT

Relative:


Absolute:

Fixed: removed from natural document flow


Divs will overlap, text and inline elements will move up
<p> is text, so it will have ability to wrap around flatted elements

Clear - will not wrap around elements in the specified direction
Clear: right; = Clear anything floated to the right
